What I need language for: I am not only teaching English but also transitioning into a more self-sufficient digital nomad style, so I need language for traveling. I also find it
  useful to learn languages for teaching English as it can be a good way to understand what students are going through and what techniques you can use to help them. Learning a
  language (even to an elementary level) can also help you understand their language and what issues they might have with English. 

What languages I’ve studied: German (conversational) Norwegian (conversational) Turkish (conversational), Russian (currently studying), Polish (basic knowledge) Arabic (limited
  knowledge), Spanish (limited knowledge), Romani (limited knowledge), Chinese (just checked it out), and Hungarian (just checked it out). 

Current daily schedule/methods: 

1.) I do 1 duolingo lesson a day and keep doing the same lesson until it is level 5. As I am doing the lesson I have a notepad and write down phrases/words that I don’t know.
  I write them down in both English and Russian. I highlight the new words in the sentence in both English and Russian so I can find them easily if I need them again. Here’s 
  what the notepad looks like: 

 <div id="myDiv">My name is Sam German</div>

<img src="01.jpg">
<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">I use Duolingo, Tinycards, Studyblue and note-taking for language learning. After the intro, I'm going to explain how I use 
                these 3 apps with my notebook for language learning and later, I'll review Duolingo. I'm also an English professor at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia and I write poetry and 
              fan fiction. I've been living abroad for 6 years.</button>

My name is Sam German and I use Duolingo, Tinycards, Studyblue and note-taking for language learning. After the intro, I'm going to explain how I use these 3 apps with my notebook for language learning and later, I'll review Duolingo. I'm also an English professor at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia and I write poetry and fan fiction. I've been living abroad for 6 years.
              <br/>What I need language for: I am not only teaching English but also transitioning into a more self-sufficient digital nomad style, so I need language for traveling. I also find it helpful to learn other languages while teaching English as it can be a good way to understand what students are going through and what techniques can help them, Learning a language (even to an elementary level) can also help you understand their language and what issues they might have with English. 
              <br/>What languages Iâ€™ve studied: German (conversational) Norwegian (conversational) Turkish (conversational), Russian (currently studying), Polish (basic knowledge) Arabic (limited knowledge), Spanish (limited knowledge), Romani (limited knowledge), Chinese (just checked it out), and Hungarian (just checked it out).<p/>

              <p>2.) I have a list of topics I use for learning new vocabulary. In the same notebook with duolingo I have a topic and then on that page I have vocabulary words related to that topic. I translate one word a day and these words are later put into one of the other apps that will be talked about later. It is a flash card app where you can create your own flash card lessons. <p/>
